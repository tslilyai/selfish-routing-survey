\section{Introduction}
Finding the best strategy for network and traffic routing has historically been a problem of great importance at the intersection of game theory and computer science. 
Seminal work by Roughgarden and Tardos framed the routing problem as a non-cooperative game,
in which players' selfish routing decisions (decisions made by users bearing only their own interests or latencies in mind) increase the social welfare cost, i.e., the overall latency of all users in the network.


Since the advent of the selfish routing model, more complex (and perhaps more realistic) models have emerged, many of which emphasize the need to take into account the complexity of human behaviors. Our paper begins with a brief overview of the traffic routing problem, the selfish model, and the limits on the optimality of routing solutions in the selfish model (termed as the ``price of anarchy"), and then goes on to present three recent alternative models, namely the altruistic model, the risk-averse model, and the diverse model. We selectively highlight the findings of these papers in the context of the original selfish routing paper, and synthesize the results into a more general framework addressing the impact of human behaviors on network routing.

%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Introduce noncooperative games / Nash equilibrium (in network setting)
%    \item Briefly introduce selfish routing paper / price of anarchy
%    \item Discuss how it is a limited view of human behavior
%    \item Briefly discuss alternatives (papers including taxes, different objectives, atomic games, studies on network structure)
%    \item Us: There are newer papers with more interesting versions of human behavior, and we present a survey of these newer papers to show how human behaviors affect price of anarchy
%\end{itemize}
