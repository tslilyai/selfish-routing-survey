\section{Introduction}
Finding the best strategy for network and traffic routing has historically been a problem of great importance combining the theoretical aspects of both game theory and computer science. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduce noncooperative games / Nash equilibrium (in network setting)
    \item Briefly introduce selfish routing paper / price of anarchy
    \item Discuss how it is a limited view of human behavior
    \item Briefly discuss alternatives (papers including taxes, different objectives, atomic games, studies on network structure)
    \item Us: There are newer papers with more interesting versions of human behavior, and we present a survey of these newer papers to show how human behaviors affect price of anarchy
\end{itemize}
