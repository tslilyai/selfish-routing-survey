\subsection{Extensions}
Clearly the models we present are a miniscule subset of all potential models for human behavior; 
furthermore, they are coarse-grained and oversimplistic in comparison with the complexity of the human
brain. As understanding of the neurophysiological aspects of human behavior improves, we hope to see a matching evolution in the precision and accuracy of these models for traffic routing as well.
