\subsection{Extensions}

The models we covered are quite limited and coarse-grained compared to the complexity of the human brain and behavior. The diversity model only explored the realm of having at most two criteria in total in the objective functions of the whole diverse network.


\subsection{Applications}


%Clearly the models we present are a miniscule subset of all potential models for human behavior; 
%furthermore, they are coarse-grained and oversimplistic in comparison with the complexity of the human
%brain. As understanding of the neurophysiological aspects of human behavior improves, we hope to see a matching evolution in the precision and accuracy of these models for traffic routing as well.
