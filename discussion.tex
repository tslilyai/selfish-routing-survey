\subsection{Extensions}

The models we covered are quite limited and coarse-grained compared to the complexity of the human brain and behavior. The diversity model only explored the realm of having at most two criteria in total in the objective functions of the whole diverse network.


\subsection{Applications}

Although knowledge we have of the affect of human nature on the optimality of a network is still quite limited, we can nevertheless leverage the knowledge to improve our decision making. There are three major ways that these knowledge can contribute:


\subsubsection{Policy Design}
As we have discussed in the diverse model section that the diverse selfish routing models help us understand how we can leverage policies and natural diversity of goals in a network to increase the social welfare and efficiency of the network as a whole. 

We mentioned the example of tolls helping implement the social optimum at equilibrium when all agents have the same goal that is a linear combination of time and money Beckmann et.al~\cite{beckmann1956studies}. There are many more things that we can put onto the table for the agents to consider if we understand the affect of those tradeoffs well on our network.


\subsubsection{Information Distribution}

To enable diversity among acting agents, we must be able to provide a variety of information to the agents. E.g. to utilize the time-money tradeoff, the agents must be informed of the estimated time of taking each route, and estimated expense of taking each route. 

The implications of information distribution goes much further beyond the time-money tradeoff, however. Imagine if we have a route A that is fast but heavy traffic on that route does a lot of damage to the environment, and another route B that is slower but has less impact on the environment. To make the environmental-concern even a criterion for any subset of the heterogeneous agents, they need to first be aware that route A does more damage to the environment. Being exposed to new information about the network is one of the most effective ways to allow the agents to possibly include multiple criteria in their objective functions. Thus, there is intrinsic value in providing more information on the network to the agents.

\subsubsection{Network Design}

As we have found that, under different assumptions of the agent behavior, we can design the network we have into different structures, in order to make sure that the affect of the previous two methods are positive. For example, as we have shown in the diversity model, we can design our network to make sure that no Braess graph can be embedded in our network, and our network is block-matching.

These important applications also point at the directions for potential future research. 

%Clearly the models we present are a miniscule subset of all potential models for human behavior; 
%furthermore, they are coarse-grained and oversimplistic in comparison with the complexity of the human
%brain. As understanding of the neurophysiological aspects of human behavior improves, we hope to see a matching evolution in the precision and accuracy of these models for traffic routing as well.
