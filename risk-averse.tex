\subsection{Risk Aversion}
The second model we consider accounts for the
tendency of users to pick routes with less variation in latency even if it comes at the cost of some added
latency on the paths chosen. This increase in latency can be quantified as the {\em{price of risk-aversion}}
which is the worst-case ratio of the latency or cost at a risk-averse Nash Equlibrium to that at a risk-neutral
Nash equilibrium or one where users are indifferent to variations in the latency itself.

%% The key result that we will be focussing on here is one where we show that the latency bounds in this context
%% is effectively the price of anarchy times the price of risk-aversion which intuitiveluy makes sense.

\subsubsection{Formalization} The {\textbf{formal model}} introduced in Lianeas et.al \cite{risk-averse} defines 
a risk aversion coefficient $\gamma$ that quantifies the users' tendency to prefer paths with less variability. 
A higher $\gamma$ means that one is more risk averse. The edge costs $c_e(x_e)$ now have a deterministic part 
or $l_e(x_e)$ and a noise modelled by a random variable $\xi_e(x_e)$. The latter is assumed to be independent across edges 
and has expectation $0$ and variance $\upsilon_e(x_e)$ for $x_e$ flow allowing us to sum them up over a path. To simplify 
the analysis, the model also defines $\upkappa$ to bound the variance-to-mean latency ratio. In other words, 
$\upsilon_e(x_e) \leq \upkappa l_e(x_e)$.
%Now,
%the expected latency and variance ($\upsilon_p$) on a path can be summed across all the edges. Consequently, our problem
%instance is $(G,r,l,\upsilon,\gamma)$ and we focus on $r = 1$ to simplify our analysis.

The cost function or the {\textbf{objective}} that every user is now optimizing for is of the form
$$c_p(f) = \sum_{e \in p}l_e(f_e) + \gamma \sum_{e \in p}\upsilon_e(f_e)$$
This function is assumed to be non-decreasing. Intuitively, the mean is identical to the original price of anarchy formulation
while the second term accounts for variance. Minimizing this implies that we want to minimize the variance depending on the
value of the risk coefficient itself.

If the maximum cost $C(x)$  across some set of nash equlibria flows $x$ for the given problem instance 
that is restricted to some family of inputs and a fixed $\upkappa$, the {\textbf{price of risk-aversion}} is now defined as the
ratio $C(x)/C(z)$. Here $C(z)$ is the cost associated with some risk-neutral nash equlibrium $z$. 
In the following section, we look at bounding this price of risk-aversion. Note that this can be viewed as contributing a 
multiplicative factor to the price of anarchy in the overall change to the latency or cost of the system. We first prove a 
more basic result from an older paper on this topic \cite{risk-averse-background} and then proceed to the main result on the price
of risk-aversion for 
a special family of latency functions that are $(\lambda, \mu)$ smooth. Note that additional results can be proved for special classes
of graph topologies which can be found in the original paper \cite{risk-averse}.

\subsubsection{Main Results}
\begin{theorem}
    If a flow $f$ is at a risk averse nash equlibrium and $f^*$ is any other flow, then $fC(f)\leq f^*C(f)$. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    By definition, any flow at Nash Equlibrium routes on paths with minimum cost or only sends flow on a given path if its cost is less than
    the cost of sending the same flow on some other path. Thus, for a fixed demand and fixed path costs determined by $C(f)$, $f^*$ differs from $f$ in 
    atleast moving some $\epsilon$ flow from one lower cost path to another higher cost one which increases the total overall cost. 
    Consequently, let's say we have a flow $x$ that is a risk averse Nash Equlibrium 
    for the cost function $c_e = l_e(x_e) +\gamma \upsilon_e(x_e)$. If $z$ is a risk neutral Nash Equlibirium, it is still feasible for the risk averse
    mean-variance cost function, but is not the equlibrium in that scenario. By the above description and costs written as the sum across edges, we have
    $$\sum_{e \in E}x_e(l_e(x_e) + \gamma \upsilon(x_e)) \leq \sum_{e \in E} z_e(l_e(x_e) + \gamma \upsilon_e(x_e))$$
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
    A function $l :\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ is $(\lambda, \mu)$-smooth around $x \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ if $yl(x) \leq \lambda yl(y) _ \mu x l(x)$ for all
    $y \in \mathbb{R}_{x \geq 0}$

    Intuitively, what this means is \XXX{add some intuition} 
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    The set of instances with latency functions ${l_e}_{e \in E}$ that are $(1,\mu)$-smooth around any risk-averse nash equlibrium $x_e$ for all $e \in E$ have price of risk-aversion
    $\leq \displaystyle \frac{(1 + \gamma \upkappa)}{(1 - \mu)}$
\end{theorem}

    seaprate into edges with flow less than $z_e$

    edges with flow greater than $x_e$
    - inequality to be subtracted
