%\begin{abstract}
%The impact of selfish actions on the latency incurred by a network users has historically been a problem of great interest to the algorithmic community. Our paper first presents a brief overview of the original selfish routing problem, the standard algorithms used to route in the selfish routing setting, and the limits on the optimality of these algorithms (termed as the ``price of anarchy"), and then compare and contrasts other recent works that have formulated the problem in
%    (perhaps more realistic) settings, i.e., by taking into account the possibility for altruistic, risk averse, and diverse-interest behaviors.  This paper both presents and clarifies the findings of these papers in the context of the original selfish routing paper, and demonstrates how these papers' results can be synthesized into a more general framework addressing optimality of routing with various human behaviors or motivations.

\section{Alternative Models}
In this section, we present and compare a subset of recent coordination models for the traffic routing problem against the selfish routing model. These models propose a more nuanced (and perhaps more accurate) description of human behavior.
\XXX{TODO more summary once we have more insights?}
