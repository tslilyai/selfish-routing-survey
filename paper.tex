\begin{abstract}
The impact of selfish actions on the latency incurred by a network users has historically been a problem of great interest to the algorithmic community. Our paper first presents a brief overview of the original selfish routing problem, the standard algorithms used to route in the selfish routing setting, and the limits on the optimality of these algorithms (termed as the ``price of anarchy"), and then compare and contrasts other recent works that have formulated the problem in
    (perhaps more realistic) settings, i.e., by taking into account the possibility for altruistic, risk averse, and diverse-interest behaviors.  This paper both presents and clarifies the findings of these papers in the context of the original selfish routing paper, and demonstrates how these papers' results can be synthesized into a more general framework addressing optimality of routing with various human behaviors or motivations.

\section{Introduction}
Finding the best strategy for network and traffic routing has historically been a problem of great importance combining the theoretical aspects of both game theory and computer science. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduce noncooperative games / Nash equilibrium (in network setting)
    \item Briefly introduce selfish routing paper / price of anarchy
    \item Discuss how it is a limited view of human behavior
    \item Briefly discuss alternatives (papers including taxes, etc.)
    \item There are newer papers with more interesting versions of human behavior
    \item We present a survey of these newer papers to show how human behaviors affect price of anarchy
\end{itemize}

\section{Background}
This section presents a brief history of traffic routing algorithms, defining the terminology
and the problem that these algorithms address.

\subsection{Multicommodity Flow Networks}
Traffic routing problems naturally arise in communication or transportation networks, where
links in the network often becomes \emph{congested} if too many users decide to route their data 
or cars through that link. In these networks, the path each user chooses can affect the travel times of other
users.

More formally, the input to a traffic routing problem consists of the following, as is defined by Roughgarden and Tardos in their seminal work on selfish routing~\cite{tardos}\cite{roughgarden}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A network $G = (V, E)$ of $|V|$ nodes (e.g., locations or servers) and $|E|$ links 
    \item A set of $k$ source-destination pairs $S=\{(s_1,t_1), \cdots (s_k,t_k)\}$ representing traffic demands
    \item A {rate} $r_i$ of traffic for each $(s_i,t_i)\in S$ representing the demanded amount of traffic from $s_i$ to $t_i$
    \item A {latency} cost function per edge $e\in E$ that describes how adding traffic (i.e.,congesting) $e$ affects how long it takes to travel time across $e$.
\end{itemize}

A \emph{feasible} solution given such an input is TODO.

An \emph{optimal} solution given such an input is TODO.

\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Importance of Human Understanding}
\subsection{Future Work}
Clearly the models we present are a miniscule subset of all potential models for human behavior; 
furthermore, they are coarse-grained and oversimplistic in comparison with the complexity of the human
brain. As understanding of the neurophysiological aspects of human behavior improves, we hope to see a matching evolution in the precision and accuracy of these models for traffic routing as well.
